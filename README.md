# Healthcare-Data-Analysis using Tableau

This project analyzes hospital data to optimize resource allocation, reduce Length of Stay (LOS), and control costs. It includes insights on high-severity cases, specialized care for bone cancer, and strategies for improving patient outcomes. Tableau is used for visualizing key metrics such as cost trends, LOS, and resource utilization to drive data-informed decisions.
